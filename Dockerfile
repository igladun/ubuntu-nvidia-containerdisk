# A builder stage exists only to set filesystem modes that COPY --chmod cannot
# express: --chmod applies ONE mode to the file AND the implicitly-created
# /disk directory, and a directory without the execute (search) bit breaks
# CDI's pullMethod=node import — its file server (uid 107) can *list* /disk but
# gets EACCES opening the qcow2, which Go's http.FileServer surfaces as a 403
# to the importer. The directory needs 0555; the disk file itself stays 0444.
# Digest-pinned (multi-arch index for 1.36-uclibc): this stage's chown/chmod
# run over the disk image, so the tag alone must not decide what executes here.
